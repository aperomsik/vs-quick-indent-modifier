# Quick Indent Modifier

Do you often work with projects using different indentation characters? Are you tired of digging through Visual Studio settings to change the desired option?
**Quick Indent Modifier** comes to the rescue!

Quick Indent Modifier is a super simple Visual Studio add-in. It provides two commands that globally change the indentation settings (the one you can find in Options/Text Editor/All Languages/Tabs) - Use spaces and Use tabs.

These commands are accessible from the Tools menu. A Quick Indent Modifier toolbar is also available, which makes the command available in the editor, saving you another mouse click. Also, nothing prevents you from creating a keyborad shortcut - look for Tools.Usespaces and Tools.Usetabs in the Key bindings panel.

## Installation
Download the extension from Visual Studio Gallery (https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/d673841b-8f58-4d5a-914c-b2a740be3fb8?SRC=VSIDE) or search for Quick Indent Modifier in the Extensions and Updates window in Visual Studio.
